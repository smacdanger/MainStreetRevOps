## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies - NEVER CANCEL: takes 30 seconds
npm install  # Set timeout to 60+ seconds
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Lint the codebase - fast execution
npm run lint  # Takes ~2 seconds

# Build for production - NEVER CANCEL: takes 25 seconds. Set timeout to 60+ minutes.
npm run build  # Uses Turbopack for faster builds

# Development server - starts in ~1 second
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000

# Production server - IMPORTANT: requires fresh build first
npm run build && npm start  # Production server on http://localhost:3000
```

### Critical Build Notes
- **NEVER CANCEL builds or long-running commands** - builds may take 25+ seconds
- **Production server requires fresh build**: Always run `npm run build` before `npm start`
- **Set timeouts appropriately**: Use 60+ seconds for build commands, 30+ seconds for install
- **Turbopack enabled**: Builds use `--turbopack` flag for faster compilation

## Validation Requirements

### ALWAYS Test These Scenarios After Changes
1. **Navigation Flow**: Test all page transitions (Home â†’ Assessment â†’ Contact â†’ Privacy)
2. **Tally Form Integration**: 
   - Test both contact and assessment forms load properly
   - Verify form submission works and shows success states
   - Check browser console for form loading errors
3. **Responsive Design**: Test navigation menu on mobile/desktop
4. **Static Page Generation**: Verify all pages build successfully in production
5. **ðŸŽ¯ CONVERSION PATH TESTING**: 
   - Verify all CTA buttons lead to contact/assessment pages
   - Test assessment form submission flow
   - Ensure pricing information is clearly visible and actionable
   - Validate mobile conversion experience (forms, buttons, CTAs)

### Manual Validation Commands
```bash
# Always validate before committing changes
npm run lint  # Must pass with no errors
npm run build  # Must complete successfully 
npm start  # Must start without errors after build

# Test in browser at http://localhost:3000
# Navigate through all pages: /, /assessment, /contact, /privacy
# Submit contact form with test data
```

### Deployment Ready
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployment
- **Netlify**: Build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `.next` or `out`
- **Static hosting**: Run `npm run build` and deploy `.next` folder

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new page.tsx file in src/app/[page-name]/
2. Export default React component with proper TypeScript typing
3. Add navigation link in src/components/Navigation.tsx (if needed)
4. **ðŸŽ¯ ALWAYS include conversion elements**: CTAs, contact forms, or assessment links
5. Test navigation and build process

### Modifying Styles
- Uses TailwindCSS v4 utility classes with Inter font
- Custom CSS animations defined in globals.css
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Color scheme: slate/teal/blue (`bg-slate-900`, `text-teal-600`, etc.)
- **ðŸŽ¯ CTA Button Styling**: Use CTAButton component with variants (primary, secondary, accent)

### Working with UI Components
- All UI components in `src/components/ui/` use Framer Motion for animations
- Components are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Reusable and composable design pattern
- Consistent spacing and color schemes

### Integration Updates
When integrating external services:
1. **Tally Forms**: Forms are already integrated - update form IDs if needed
2. **Email Links**: Update email addresses from Sean@mainstrevops.com if needed
3. **LinkedIn**: Update LinkedIn profile links from seanmacd profile
4. **ðŸŽ¯ Analytics Integration**: Add Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or conversion tracking
5. **ðŸŽ¯ CRM Integration**: Connect Tally forms to HubSpot, Salesforce, or lead management system

## Troubleshooting

### Production Server Issues
If `npm start` fails with route manifest errors:
```bash
# Solution: Clean build and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm start
```

### Build Cache Issues
If builds are slow or inconsistent:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Tally Form Issues
If Tally forms don't load:
1. Check browser console for script loading errors
2. Verify Tally embed URLs are correct
3. Test retry mechanisms are working
4. Fallback: Forms will show iframe directly if Tally.js fails

### Linting Errors
All code must pass ESLint before committing:
```bash
npm run lint  # Fix any errors before proceeding
```

## Expected Timings
- **npm install**: 30 seconds (first time) 
- **npm run lint**: 2 seconds
- **npm run build**: 25 seconds with Turbopack
- **npm run dev**: 1 second startup time
- **npm start**: 1 second startup (after successful build)

**CRITICAL**: Always allow sufficient time for operations to complete. NEVER CANCEL builds or installs prematurely.
