## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies - NEVER CANCEL: takes 30 seconds
npm install  # Set timeout to 60+ seconds
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Lint the codebase - fast execution
npm run lint  # Takes ~2 seconds

# Build for production - NEVER CANCEL: takes 25 seconds. Set timeout to 60+ minutes.
npm run build  # Uses Turbopack for faster builds

# Development server - starts in ~1 second
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000

# Production server - IMPORTANT: requires fresh build first
npm run build && npm start  # Production server on http://localhost:3000
```

### Critical Build Notes
- **NEVER CANCEL builds or long-running commands** - builds may take 25+ seconds
- **Production server requires fresh build**: Always run `npm run build` before `npm start`
- **Set timeouts appropriately**: Use 60+ seconds for build commands, 30+ seconds for install
- **Turbopack enabled**: Builds use `--turbopack` flag for faster compilation

- **ðŸŽ¯ Conversion Priority**: CRITICAL - this is a direct sales lead capture

### Assessment Page (src/app/assessment/page.tsx)  
- **Business Purpose**: PRIMARY LEAD MAGNET - captures prospect information while providing value
- **Status**: Placeholder for Google Forms integration
- **Integration needed**: Replace placeholder with actual Google Forms embed code
- **Current content**: Sample question structure for discovery questionnaire
- **ðŸŽ¯ Conversion Priority**: HIGHEST - this is the main lead generation tool

### Deployment Ready
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployment
- **Netlify**: Build command: `npm run build`, publish directory: `.next` or `out`
- **Static hosting**: Run `npm run build` and deploy `.next` folder

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new page.tsx file in src/app/[page-name]/
2. Export default React component with proper TypeScript typing
3. Add navigation link in src/components/Navigation.tsx
4. **ðŸŽ¯ ALWAYS include conversion elements**: CTAs, contact forms, or assessment links
5. Test navigation and build process

### Modifying Styles
- Uses TailwindCSS v4 utility classes
- No custom CSS files needed
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Blue/white/gray color scheme (`bg-blue-600`, `text-gray-900`, etc.)
- **ðŸŽ¯ CTA Button Styling**: Use `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700` for primary actions

### Integration Updates
When integrating external services:
1. **Contact Form**: Update form submission handler in contact/page.tsx
2. **Calendly**: Replace placeholder link in contact page  
3. **Google Forms**: Update assessment page with embed code
4. **Email Links**: Update mailto links with actual business email
5. **ðŸŽ¯ Analytics Integration**: Add Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or conversion tracking
6. **ðŸŽ¯ CRM Integration**: Connect forms to HubSpot, Salesforce, or lead management system

## Troubleshooting

### Production Server Issues
If `npm start` fails with route manifest errors:
```bash
# Solution: Clean build and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm start
```

### Build Cache Issues
If builds are slow or inconsistent:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Linting Errors
All code must pass ESLint before committing:
```bash
npm run lint  # Fix any errors before proceeding
```

## Expected Timings
- **npm install**: 30 seconds (first time) 
- **npm run lint**: 2 seconds
- **npm run build**: 25 seconds with Turbopack
- **npm run dev**: 1 second startup time
- **npm start**: 1 second startup (after successful build)

**CRITICAL**: Always allow sufficient time for operations to complete. NEVER CANCEL builds or installs prematurely.
